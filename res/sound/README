# MANAGING SOUND FILES FOR MONKEY WORLD                                        #
################################################################################

  === Quick intro ===
  Monkey World needs its sound files in .ogg and .mp3 format.

  To convert all files with the extension .wav in the current working directory
  to mp3 and ogg, run the following script:
  
    > ./convert.sh wav
  
  The script needs to have lame, oggenc and mplayer installed.
  
  === Long version ===
  Since all major web browsers have implemented different audio support for the
  HTML5 audio tag, Monkey World needs to convert its audio file to each
  supported format.

  As of April 2012, this is a subset of the support, according to W3C:

              mp3   wav   ogg
    ---------------------------
     IE9    |  x
     FF     |        x     x
     Chrome |  x     x     x
     Safari |  x     x
     Opera  |        x     x

  Furthermore, Monkey World's current sound engine (SoundJS v0.2.0) doesn't seem
  to support wav. Thus, to confirm to all major browers and the engine, each
  sound file should be available in both mp3 and ogg format. This is how to do
  it:

  To convert an existing set of sound files (for example in wav format), run the
  script convert.sh with the parameter wav:

    > ./convert.sh wav

  It will convert all the files with the extension .wav in the working directory
  to the corresponding .mp3 and .ogg files.
